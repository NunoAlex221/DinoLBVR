      - "[STATE]"
      is just a placeholder, change it to the State name it will affect.


      -
      To do this for each state you need to duplicate the "ACTIVATOR_[STATE]" and
      (if needed/wanted) the "STATE TIMER_[STATE]".'

      the \"CONTENT\" game object, then it will be renamed to \"[AlternateContent]

      to create it by right clicking in a \"Project\" window > Create > XRoam > Camera
      > Fade Configuration. Same with the \"Alternate Content Config\".\n\n\t4.3.
      The Fade Configuration recomended settings are:\n\n\t\t- Fade In Seconds: 1\n\t\t-
      Faded Seconds: 0.2\n\t\t- Fade Out Seconds: 1\n\t\t- Color: Black\n\n\t4.4.
      For the Alternate Content Configuration settings:\n\n\t\t- Priority: 0\n\t\t-
      Overlay: ON\n\t\t- Background Color: Black\n\n\t4.5. After setting these configurations,
      add them to the \"Alternate Content\" script in \"ALTERNATE CONTENT_[STATE]\"
      in their respective parameters.\n\n\t4.6. Change the Layer for the \"[AlternateContent]
      CONTENT\" game object and everything inside to \"XROAM_ALTERNATE_CONTENT\".\n\n\t4.7.
      The \"VISUAL\" gameobject is a PolyLine that uses de \"Shapes\" package. It
      is used to limit the walkable area with points connected drawing lines. You
      can add more points with tifferent positions and colors to adjust to your walkable
      area and liking.\n\n\t4.8. You can add anything you want to see while in the
      alternate content inside the \"[AlternateContent] CONTENT\", but make sure
      its on the \"XROAM_ALTERNATE_CONTENT\" Layer."

      Set the function to \"AudioMixerMasterController.FadeToVolume\" and set it

      In the other one add again the \"MASTER MIXER WALKABLE\" gameobject with the
      same function as on the Enter actions and set it to -12.\n\n\t5.5. If you need

      State you want to start the timer on.\n\n\t6.2. The \"Delay\" parameter is
      the maximum time you want the user to spend in one state.\n\n\t6.3. On the

      everything and then duplicate.\n\n- If there're similar rooms in dimension,

      to avoid extra work setting the walkable area visuals and colliders.\n\nIf
      the alternate content it is not showing up in the Game window but it is in
      the Scene one:\n\n\t- Check the order of the \"Stack\" in the \"Main Camera\"

      Content\n\t\t3. Fade Camera\n\t\t4. Guardian Camera\n\t\t5. OTHERS\n\n\t- Make
      sure the \"Priority\" of the Alternate Content Configuration is higher than
      the alternate content for it to be rendered behind the desired content and
      the \"Overlay\" is checked.\n\n\t- The alternate content group and objects
      inside have to be on the \"XROAM_ALTERNATE_CONTENT\" layer.\n\n\t- Reimport
      the \"Shapes\" package\n\n\t- If working with URP, make sure that in the URP
      Renderer Data there's a \"Shapes Renderer Feature\", if not add it."
